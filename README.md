# Representation Learning of Meshes Based on SIMCLR Method

In this project, I explore the contrastive learning method proposed by Chen et al. in [A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) using the existing [MeshCNN](https://github.com/ranahanocka/MeshCNN) framework. 


## Getting Started
