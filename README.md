# Representation Learning of Meshes Based on SIMCLR Method

In this project, I explore the contrastive learning method proposed by Chen et al. in [A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) using the existing [MeshCNN](https://github.com/ranahanocka/MeshCNN) framework, a general-purpose deep neural network for learning on meshes. 


## Getting Started

Clone this repo to your own working directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/shuyuan-lily/Contrastive_Meshes.git
```
Set up your working environment with:
```
conda env create -f contrastive_meshes.yml
```
